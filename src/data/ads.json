The cheapest price covers our basic production costs &ndash; the other prices go towards our social efforts and supporting an independent brand.</p><h4>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h4><p>Simply select the lens options for your second pair, then at the final step you choose the price and add to your cart. Pay What You Can is only available if both pairs are purchased at the same time.</p><h4>WHY ARE YOU DOING IT?</h4><p>Many of you buy more than one pair of glasses from us. For those who don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s usually because they cannot afford it. Offering the chance to buy our glasses at a lower price makes them affordable to more people. And this has been our mission since Day 1: to offer designer eyewear at an affordable price. Enjoy!</p>"
